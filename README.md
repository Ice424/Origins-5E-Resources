>this pack's item overrides start at predicate 0 & scoreboard are not prefixed which might make compatibility with other packs more hit & miss 

## More about 

The pack contains 118 powers that span across 5 classes with shared powers between them

powers are split up between:

- Low
  - These are general stat increases like hp or strength
- High
  - More interesting but still available across all classes e.g. size changing
- Class
  - Class powers are also split up between
  - Passive
    - Stats given once the user picks the class like status effects & health changes
  - High
    - Powers that are specific to the class can be either key activated or passive
  - Special
    - Stronger powers that are specific to the class can be either key activated or passive

The powers are purchased from an item shop crafted by 8 cobblestone around a chest each. Power costs a different amount of "origin essence" depending on the type of power. Origin essence can be found in loot chests across the world but also in trial chambers for an unlimited supply
